# CS2505 Fall 2015 Chrome Extension
*by Joey Watts*

## About
This chrome extension reorganizes the assignments on the curator to shown the most recent assignments first by reversing the list of assignments. It also adds a button on the assignments page that copies a command to your clipboard that, when run in a Linux terminal, will download all associated files for that assignment. It also removes the hideously ugly background on the course page.

## Usage
Either clone the repo locally and install it in developer mode, or [download](https://github.com/joeywatts/CS2505-chrome-ext/releases/latest) the packed extension and open it with Chrome.
